description: Use when <slug>-requirements.md and <slug>-tech-design.md exist for a feature, before touching code. Reads both, produces <slug>-implementation-plan.md (단계별 plan with bite-sized TDD tasks). Ends with the main agent's spec verification gate (verifying-spec) — covers 요구사항 + 개발방향 ↔ 구현계획서 consistency + code impact.

# Writing Plans → <slug>-implementation-plan.md

Take <slug>-requirements.md + <slug>-tech-design.md as inputs and produce a comprehensive implementation plan (`<slug>-implementation-plan.md`) decomposed into bite-sized TDD tasks. The upstream superpowers patterns (exact file paths, complete code in every step, TDD cycle, no placeholders, frequent commits) are inherited as-is. js-superpowers extends them with: change-history footer, structured "위험 코드 지점" section, and a verification gate after save.

<HARD-GATE>
Both <slug>-requirements.md and <slug>-tech-design.md must exist in the current feature folder. If either is missing, instruct the user to run /brainstorm or /design first.
</HARD-GATE>

## Checklist

You MUST create a TaskCreate task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Verify inputs** — confirm both <slug>-requirements.md and <slug>-tech-design.md exist (HARD-GATE if either missing)
2. **Outline file structure** — which files are created/modified, with single-responsibility boundaries
3. **Decompose into bite-sized tasks** — each task = one TDD cycle (test → fail → impl → pass → commit), 2-5 minutes per step
4. **Fill 위험 코드 지점 (§2)** — every risk category from <slug>-tech-design.md §6 mapped to a concrete location + mitigation
5. **Self-review** — spec coverage / placeholder scan / type consistency / 위험 coverage
6. **User reviews <slug>-implementation-plan.md** — show the file, get approval (loop until OK)
7. **Invoke verifying-spec** (with Tolerance for missing skill) — main agent runs A+C verification on the plan
8. **Invoke change-history skill** — append first `[구현계획서-수정]` entry
9. **Hand off to /execute-plan** (offer Subagent-Driven vs Inline Execution choice)

If you find yourself skipping ahead, stop and create the missing task.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity (inherited from upstream)

Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):
- "Write the failing test" — step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" — step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" — step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" — step
- "Commit" — step (skip if git is not initialized)

## Plan Document Header (REQUIRED)

Every implementation plan MUST start with:

```markdown
# <Feature Name> 구현계획서

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `subagent-driven-development` (recommended) or `executing-plans` to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** <one sentence>

**Architecture:** <2-3 sentences from <slug>-tech-design.md §1>

**Tech Stack:** <key technologies>

**Spec inputs:**
- <slug>-requirements.md — <key FRs touched>
- <slug>-tech-design.md — <key decisions/architecture>

---
```

## Task Structure (inherited)

````markdown
### Task N: <Component Name>

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit (skip if no git)**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```

    "Read <slug>-requirements.md + <slug>-tech-design.md" -> "File structure outline";
    "File structure outline" -> "Decompose into bite-sized tasks";
    "Decompose into bite-sized tasks" -> "Self-review (internal)";
    "Self-review (internal)" -> "Run verifying-spec FIRST";
    "Run verifying-spec FIRST" -> "Single combined approval gate\n(plan + verify report)";
    "Single combined approval gate\n(plan + verify report)" -> "Self-review (internal)" [label="fix / partial"];
    "Single combined approval gate\n(plan + verify report)" -> "Invoke change-history" [label="approve"];
    "Invoke change-history" -> "Hand off to /execute-plan";
}
```

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- Smaller, focused files beat large files that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. Don't restructure unless an unwieldy file actively blocks the work.

## §2 위험 코드 지점

After tasks are written, fill `## 2. 위험 코드 지점` with concrete entries:

```markdown
## 2. 위험 코드 지점

- `src/wallet/service.py:42-58` — side-effect: 잔액이 -로 갈 수 있음 (mitigation: amount 검증 + 트랜잭션)
- `src/api/wallet_routes.py:withdraw` — breaking: 응답 스키마에 transaction_id 추가 (mitigation: 클라이언트 호환성 확인)
```

Categories MUST come from risk-annotation taxonomy: `side-effect | race | breaking | perf`. Each entry pairs a location with a mitigation strategy.

## §3 롤백 전략

```markdown
## 3. 롤백 전략

- Code: revert commits SHA-A..SHA-B (or stash + reset)
- DB: migration <name> has down(), run `alembic downgrade -1`
- Config: feature flag `wallet.withdraw.v2` defaults off
```

## No Placeholders (inherited)

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Remember

- **Exact file paths always** — `src/wallet/service.py:42-58`, never "the wallet service"
- **Complete code in every step** — if a step changes code, show the code in a code block
- **Exact commands with expected output** — never "run the tests" without the command + expected outcome
- **DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits** — these aren't slogans, they're rules

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Spec coverage**: Skim each FR and key decision in <slug>-requirements.md and <slug>-tech-design.md. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.
2. **Placeholder scan**: Search for any of the patterns from "No Placeholders" above. Fix them.
3. **Type consistency**: Function names, signatures, and property names must match across tasks (e.g., `clearLayers()` in Task 3 vs `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug).
4. **위험 코드 지점 coverage**: Every category in <slug>-tech-design.md §6 has at least one corresponding entry in §2.

If you find issues, fix them inline. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| Steps that say "implement X" without code | Show the actual code in a code block. |
| TODO / TBD / "later" markers | Forbidden. Resolve before saving. |
| Tasks bigger than ~30 minutes | Decompose further. Each TDD cycle should fit one Task. |
| Skipping §2 위험 코드 지점 | Required. Every risk category from <slug>-tech-design.md §6 must appear here. |

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The engineer can figure out the details" | They can't, and shouldn't have to. Spell it out. |
| "Skip TDD for trivial tasks" | TDD is the discipline that catches the surprises. Keep the cycle. |
| "Plan is too long" | Length is fine if every step is concrete. Vague brevity is worse. |

## After Save — single approval gate, then execution-mode choice

This summarizes the corrected order (matches Checklist + Process Flow above):

1. **Run verifying-spec FIRST** (before any user prompt):
   - Target: `<slug>-implementation-plan.md`
   - Upstream: `[<slug>-requirements.md, <slug>-tech-design.md]`
   - Procedure: consistency (FR + key decisions covered as tasks) + code impact (files/functions referenced exist or are explicitly created)
   - **Tolerance**: if verifying-spec skill is not installed, skip and emit the notice ("ℹ️ verify-gate 미설치, Phase 2 이후 활성화 — 검증 없이 진행")

2. **Single combined approval gate** — present in ONE message:
   - The full `<slug>-implementation-plan.md` (or summary if very long, with link)
   - The verify-spec 4-axis report
   - One question: "Approve `<slug>-implementation-plan.md` and proceed? — yes / fix / partial"
   - DO NOT split into "approve plan" → "approve verify report". One gate, one decision.

3. On `yes` → invoke change-history (`[구현계획서-수정]` entry) → continue to Execution Handoff below.
   On `fix` → re-decompose specific tasks, then re-run from "Self-review (internal)".
   On `partial` → ask which sections/tasks to revisit, then re-enter.

## Execution Handoff

After verification passes and the entry is logged, offer execution choice:

> "Plan complete and saved to `docs/features/<date>-<slug>/<slug>-implementation-plan.md`. Two execution options:
>
> 1. **Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration
> 2. **Inline Execution** — execute tasks in this session using executing-plans, batch with checkpoints
>
> Which approach?"

If Subagent-Driven chosen → REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: `subagent-driven-development`
If Inline chosen → REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: `executing-plans`
