name: setting-up-worktrees
description: Use when the user asks to create one or more git worktrees ("워크트리 만들어줘", "<티켓명> 워크트리"). Default location is <project-root>/.worktrees/<branch-name>; creates the branch from current HEAD if it doesn't exist, then auto-copies ALL existing .env* files (.env, .env.local, .env.production, etc.) AND symlinks the main repo's Claude Code memory folder so the worktree shares user/feedback/project memory from the start. NEVER asks the user which env files to copy — always auto-glob.

# Setting Up Worktrees (Quick Batch Creation)

User-personal workflow shortcut for spinning up multiple parallel work streams. Each worktree gets its own branch, an automatic copy of every `.env*` file in the project root (so the user can build/run servers concurrently without env-loading fights), AND a symlink to the main repo's Claude Code memory folder (so user/feedback/project memory is immediately available in the worktree's first session).

<HARD-GATE>
This skill MUST be invoked from a git repository. If the current working directory is not inside a git repo (`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` returns false), abort and tell the user to run `git init` first or switch to the target project.
</HARD-GATE>

<HARD-GATE>
NEVER ask the user which env files to copy. ALWAYS auto-glob `.env*` in the project root and copy every match. The user only specifies branch names — env-file selection is automatic. The single exception: if the user EXPLICITLY says "X 파일은 복사하지 마" (exclude pattern), honor that.
</HARD-GATE>

## Trigger Examples

- 단수: `/worktree feature-a`
- 복수: `/worktree feature-a feature-b feature-c`
- 자연어: "워크트리 3개 만들어줘. 브랜치는 feature-a, feature-b, feature-c."

> 사용자가 실제 티켓명(예: `TICKET-123-기능명`)으로 호출하면 그대로 브랜치명에 사용한다. 위 `feature-a` 등은 placeholder.

## Defaults (No User Prompt)

| Knob | Default behavior |
|---|---|
| Worktree root | `<project-root>/.worktrees/` (override only if user explicitly asks) |
| Branch creation | If branch missing → `-b <name>` from current HEAD. Existing local → use as-is. Remote-only → `-B <name> origin/<name>` |
| Env files copied | **Auto-glob `.env*` (excludes `.env.example`, `.env.sample`)**. ALL matches copied to every worktree. |
| Claude memory folder | **Symlink** main repo's `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-main>/memory` → `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-wt>/memory`. Skip if main has no memory yet, or if worktree's memory dir already exists (don't clobber). |
| `.worktrees/` in `.gitignore` | Auto-add if missing |

}
```

## Procedure (Step-by-Step)

**Step 0 — Verify git context**

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree   # must print "true"
ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

If not in a repo, abort with: "현재 디렉터리가 git repo 아닙니다. `git init` 후 다시 호출해주세요."

**Step 1 — Parse branch names from user's message**

Extract `BRANCHES=(...)` from the user's message. Korean ticket-style names like `<TICKET>-<번호>-<설명>` are fine (UTF-8 OK). Do NOT ask about env files — those are auto-detected.

**Step 2 — Auto-detect `.env*` files (NO user prompt)**

```bash
ENV_FILES=()
for f in "$ROOT"/.env*; do
    [ -f "$f" ] || continue
    name=$(basename "$f")
    # Skip templates (committed examples) — they're already in the worktree via git checkout
    case "$name" in
        .env.example|.env.sample|.env.template) continue ;;
    esac
    ENV_FILES+=("$name")
done
```

If `ENV_FILES` is empty after this, log a notice ("ℹ️ 프로젝트 루트에 .env* 파일 없음 — env 복사 skip") and proceed without copying. Don't abort.

**Step 3 — Ensure `.worktrees/` exists and is gitignored**

```bash
mkdir -p "$ROOT/.worktrees"

if ! grep -qE '^\.worktrees/?$' "$ROOT/.gitignore" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo ".worktrees/" >> "$ROOT/.gitignore"
fi
```

**Step 4 — For each branch, create or attach the worktree**

```bash
for BR in "${BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    WT_PATH="$ROOT/.worktrees/$BR"

    # Already a worktree? Skip with notice
    if [ -d "$WT_PATH" ]; then
        echo "⏭️  $BR — 이미 존재 ($WT_PATH), 건너뜀"
        continue
    fi

    # Branch exists locally?
    if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$BR"; then
        git worktree add "$WT_PATH" "$BR"
    # Exists on remote?
    elif git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/origin/$BR"; then
        git worktree add -B "$BR" "$WT_PATH" "origin/$BR"
    # Brand new
    else
        git worktree add -b "$BR" "$WT_PATH"
    fi
done
```

**Step 5 — Copy ALL detected env files into each worktree (no prompts)**

```bash
for BR in "${BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    WT_PATH="$ROOT/.worktrees/$BR"
    [ -d "$WT_PATH" ] || continue   # was skipped earlier
    for EF in "${ENV_FILES[@]}"; do
        cp "$ROOT/$EF" "$WT_PATH/$EF"
        echo "📋 $BR ← $EF 복사 완료"
    done
done
```

**Step 5.5 — Symlink Claude Code memory folder (no user prompt)**

Claude Code encodes the working directory into the memory path: each absolute path's `/` AND `_` characters become `-`. Without a symlink, a worktree session sees zero memory and the user starts cold despite years of context in the main repo. Note: simple `sed 's|/|-|g'` is INSUFFICIENT — `_` must also be converted (e.g. `jinsup_space` → `jinsup-space`).

```bash
encode_claude_path() {
    # Replace BOTH / and _ with - (Claude Code's actual encoding rule)
    echo "$1" | sed 's|[/_]|-|g'
}

MAIN_ENC=$(encode_claude_path "$ROOT")
MAIN_MEMORY="$HOME/.claude/projects/${MAIN_ENC}/memory"

for BR in "${BRANCHES[@]}"; do
    WT_PATH="$ROOT/.worktrees/$BR"
    [ -d "$WT_PATH" ] || continue   # was skipped earlier

    # Skip if main has no memory yet (first-ever use, nothing to share)
    if [ ! -d "$MAIN_MEMORY" ]; then
        echo "ℹ️  $BR — 메인 레포에 Claude 메모리 폴더 없음 (아직 메모리 0건). 심링크 생략."
        continue
    fi

    WT_ENC=$(encode_claude_path "$WT_PATH")
    WT_PROJECT_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/${WT_ENC}"
    WT_MEMORY="${WT_PROJECT_DIR}/memory"

    # If WT memory already exists (file, dir, or symlink), DON'T clobber.
    # User may have already started a session in this worktree path before — manual migration required.
    if [ -e "$WT_MEMORY" ] || [ -L "$WT_MEMORY" ]; then
        echo "⏭️  $BR — 워크트리 메모리 폴더가 이미 존재 ($WT_MEMORY). 자동 심링크 생략 — 필요 시 사용자가 수동 마이그레이션."
        continue
    fi

    mkdir -p "$WT_PROJECT_DIR"
    ln -s "$MAIN_MEMORY" "$WT_MEMORY"
    echo "🔗 $BR ← Claude 메모리 폴더 심링크 ($MAIN_MEMORY)"
done
```

Behavior summary:
- Main memory dir missing → skip with notice (first-run user, nothing to share yet).
- Worktree memory dir already exists → skip without clobbering (user already ran a session in that path).
- Otherwise → symlink. New memories saved in either side are visible from both.

⚠️ Cleanup note: when the user later removes a worktree, `git worktree remove` will not touch the symlink (lives outside the worktree dir) — no risk to main memory. But `rm -rf <worktree-path>` is also safe because the memory symlink is OUTSIDE the worktree directory (`~/.claude/projects/...`), not inside it. The only thing to watch is users manually `rm -rf $HOME/.claude/projects/<wt-encoded>/memory` — that would delete the LINK, not the target, so still safe; whereas `rm -rf $HOME/.claude/projects/<wt-encoded>/memory/` (with trailing slash on some shells) could traverse into the linked main memory. Add a tiny note in the report so the user knows.

**Step 6 — Report summary**

Print a Korean-friendly summary listing each worktree path + the env files copied:

```
✅ 워크트리 생성 완료 (n개)
감지된 .env* 파일: .env, .env.local, .env.production (3개)
Claude 메모리 폴더: 메인 → 워크트리 심링크 (n개)

- feature-a   → .worktrees/feature-a   (.env ✓ .env.local ✓ .env.production ✓ | 🔗 memory)
- feature-b   → .worktrees/feature-b   (.env ✓ .env.local ✓ .env.production ✓ | 🔗 memory)
- feature-c   → .worktrees/feature-c   (.env ✓ .env.local ✓ .env.production ✓ | 🔗 memory)

각 워크트리에서 바로 빌드·서버 실행 가능합니다.
워크트리 첫 세션부터 메인 레포의 Claude 메모리(user/feedback/project) 즉시 활용됩니다.
정리: `git worktree remove <path>` — 메모리 심링크는 워크트리 디렉터리 밖이라 메인 메모리에 영향 없음.
```

## Anti-Patterns

| Wrong | Right |
|---|---|
| Asking the user "which env files to copy?" | Forbidden by HARD-GATE. Auto-glob `.env*` and copy all (except templates). |
| Skipping env copy because user didn't mention it | Always copy all detected `.env*`. The point is build-ready worktrees. |
| Force-create when worktree path already exists | Detect + skip with notice. Don't clobber user's WIP. |
| Skip `.gitignore` update | Always add `.worktrees/` (idempotent check). |
| Use `git checkout -b` first then `worktree add` | Prefer `worktree add -b <branch> <path>` (atomic). |
| Copy `.env.example` (template, already in git) | Excluded from glob. |
| `sed 's\|/\|-\|g'` for Claude memory path encoding | INCOMPLETE — Claude Code also converts `_` → `-`. Use `sed 's\|[/_]\|-\|g'`. |
| Clobber worktree's existing memory dir with a symlink | Forbidden. If `$WT_MEMORY` already exists, skip and tell user to migrate manually. |
| Skip the symlink because "user didn't ask for it" | Always attempt. The whole point is zero-friction worktree start. Only skip when main memory missing or WT memory already there. |

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Branch name has Korean — might break" | git handles UTF-8 branch names fine. Don't sanitize unless user asks. |
| "Should I confirm which env files?" | NO. HARD-GATE forbids it. Auto-glob always. |
| ".gitignore is annoying to update" | Idempotent: only append if not already there. One-time cost. |
| "User has secrets in .env, scary to copy automatically" | Files are already on disk; copying within the same machine doesn't expand exposure. The .worktrees/ folder is gitignored. |

## Cleanup (separate operation)

If the user later asks to remove a worktree:

```bash
git worktree remove "$ROOT/.worktrees/<branch>"
git branch -d <branch>   # only if no longer needed
```

This skill does NOT auto-remove. Removal is destructive and must be explicit.

## Acceptance

After running this skill:
1. Each requested branch has a worktree at `<root>/.worktrees/<branch>/`
2. Every `.env*` file from the project root (except `.env.example`/`.env.sample`/`.env.template`) is copied into each worktree
3. `.worktrees/` is in `.gitignore`
4. `git worktree list` shows all created worktrees
5. For each worktree, `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-wt-path>/memory` is a symlink pointing to the main repo's memory dir — UNLESS main has no memory yet (first run) or the worktree's memory dir already existed (don't clobber). Encoding rule: replace BOTH `/` and `_` with `-`.
6. User got a summary report listing each worktree's path + per-file copy status + memory symlink status
7. The user was NOT asked which env files to copy, NOR about the memory symlink
